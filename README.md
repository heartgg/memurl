# Memurl
### A memorable URL generator
Do you ever have a complicated link you want to share with someone, but don't have the ability to send the link? Memurl makes it easy to get a memorable and easy-to-dictate link from your complicated URL. 

WARNING: The generated links do expire after a certain amount of time, so it's not advised to put the link in any permanent place.

This app is currently hosted on Heroku.
Check it out [here](https://memurl.herokuapp.com/).

If you'd like to host the app yourself, all you need is a Firestore database and a place to host an HTTP server.
